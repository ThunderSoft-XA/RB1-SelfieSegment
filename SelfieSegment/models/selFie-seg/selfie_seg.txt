Model Architecture
Convolutional Neural Network: MobileNetV3-like with customized decoder blocks for real-time performance.

Input(s)
General model: A frame of video or an image, represented as a 256 x 256 x 3 tensor.

Landscape model: A 144 x 256 x 3 tensor. 

Channels order: RGB with values in [0.0, 1.0].



Output(s)
Generaal model: 256 x 256 x 1 tensor with a mask of person, where values are in range [0, 1.0].

Landscape model: 144 x 256 x 1 tensor with a mask of person, where values are in range [0, 1.0].
